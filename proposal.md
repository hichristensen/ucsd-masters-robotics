# Executive Summary {-}

This document is a proposal for a new *Online Masters of Robotics* (O. M.Rob.)
to be offered by the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of
California, San Diego. The proposed program seeks to leverage the
faculty and research resources already existing in the various
Engineering departments that take part in the Jacobs School of
Engineering *Contextual Robotics Institute* to offer a world-class
program in robotics at UC San Diego with the following aims:

1) Offer a Masters level degree in robotics that is
suitable for graduate students from a range of diverse backgrounds and
disciplines in Science and Engineering;

2) Provide students with current knowledge and practical experience in
the broad areas of science, engineering and mathematics that comprise
the rapidly developing field of robotics;

3) Provide a program that covers the broad areas of robotics while
offering opportunities for in-depth studies in various areas of
specialization;

4) Prepare students for a professional career in robotics and related
areas.

Robotics is one of the fastest growing fields of Engineering with a
high demand for skilled, well trained engineers, that is projected to
continue to grow as robotics become part of everyday life at home, at
school, at the government, and at the industry. Yet, there are only a
few Master programs nationally and internationally that are focused on
the field of robotics.

The proposed program is multidisciplinary and will draw from a myriad
fields of engineering and science, including computer science,
mechanical engineering, artificial intelligence, computer vision,
electrical engineering, control systems, human-robot/computer
interaction, and biomedical engineering, and will be structure around
*foundational*, *breadth* and *depth* requirements, designed to bridge
the knowledge and experience gap between an undergraduate engineering
degree and a successful career in the field of robotics.

We expect our students to become leaders in robotics research in
academia, industry and government. At the completion of the program
students will be prepared to work independently and in teams to
accomplish the many tasks necessary to understand, build and operate
complex robotic systems, including mathematical analysis, mechanical
design, electronics, programming, while accounting for the system's
interaction with the physical and human environment.

# Introduction

## Aims and Objectives

The *Masters of Robotics* (M.Rob.) program proposed in this document
seeks to leverage the faculty and research resources already existing
in the various Engineering departments that take part in the Jacobs
School of Engineering (JSoE) *Contextual Robotics Institute* (CRI) to
offer a world-class program in robotics with the following aims:

1) Offer a Masters level degree in robotics that is
suitable for graduate students from a range of diverse backgrounds and
disciplines in Science and Engineering;

2) Provide students with current knowledge and practical experience in
the broad areas of science, engineering and mathematics that comprise
the rapidly developing field of robotics;

3) Provide a program that covers the broad areas of robotics while
offering opportunities for in-depth studies in various areas of
specialization;

4) Prepare students for a professional career in robotics and related
areas.

Our faculty and courses will come mostly from the Computer Science and
Engineering (CSE), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Departments at the JSoE.

One of the main challenges in establishing a successful graduate
program in Robotics is making sure that students coming from diverse
engineering and science fields can fully benefit from the offered
courses and research opportunities regardless of their background. We
expect most of our students to come from undergraduate degrees in
traditional, robotics-related majors such as Mechanical Engineering,
Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science. We also expect a diverse
mix of experiences, from fresh graduates to more seasoned
professionals looking for opportunities of learning and growth in the
ever present field of robotics. We accomplish this goal by
establishing *foundational*, *breadth* and *depth* requirements, to be
discussed later. These requirements are designed to bridge the
knowledge and experience gap between an undergraduate engineering
degree and a successful career in the field of robotics.

The program will draw from many fields of engineering, including
computer science, mechanical engineering, artificial intelligence,
computer vision, electrical engineering, control systems,
human-robot/computer interaction, and biomedical engineering. 

We expect our students to become leaders in robotics research in
academia, industry and government. At the completion of the program
students will be prepared to work independently and in teams to
accomplish the many tasks necessary to understand, build and operate
complex robotic systems, including mathematical analysis, mechanical
design, electronics, programming, while accounting for the system's
interaction with the physical and human environment.

## Historical development of the field

Robotics is now a 60 year old field. It was initially launched to
provide automation for factories mainly to achieve higher precision
and to alleviate heavy lifts. The objective was to handle dirty, dull,
and dangerous tasks. Around 1970 the field expanded to include service
tasks. The field of robotics today include applications in
manufacturing, services, healthcare, defense and space. Robots are
used in air, ground, space and underwater. Recently, one witness a
trend of increasing integration of robots into the many aspects of
modern society. A few examples include application as diverse as
manufacturing, assistance to elderly people in their homes,
self-driving cars, autonomous aircrafts - drones, exploration of
remote planets, and monitoring of the environment.

While early robots were used entirely on their own and often behind a
fence, modern robots are used in direct collaboration with
humans. Besides a mechanism for physical interaction with the world,
modern robots have a set of sensors that understand the state of robot
as well as the environment in which it operates, and a control system
that regulates the physical interaction with the world based on the
robot's interpretation of the world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
used for planning of actions over time and human-robot interaction
methods are used for interoperating with people. Today's robots are
complex systems that require expertise from all areas of MAE, ECE, CSE
and Cognitive Science to be built, programmed and operated.

The field of robotics has grown from a few hundred units per year to
sales that exceeds $30B/year and is experiencing an annual growth at a
rate of 20%. This impressive growth rate has been more or less
constant over the last 15 years. As robotics grows in China one should
expect the growth rate to increase. As a country, China is seeing 50%
year-to-year annual growth in sales of robotic systems.

The proposed M.Rob. program will ready students for working in this
vibrant field of robotics and its impressive and still growing range of
applications. The impact of the program will be felt locally, as local
companies such as Qualcomm, General Atomics, Northrop Grumman, Brain
Corporation, TuSimple, and others become more engaged in robotics, as
well as nationally and internationally, as demand for a skilled
workforce in the field of robotics continues to grow.

## Timetable for the development of the program

We expect to start accepting our first cohort of students in 2020.

We plan to accept 25 students in the first cohort and eventually grow
to 75 by 2025.

Those figures are in line with the current campus enrollment plans.

More details on the projected needs will be provided in [Projected
Needs](#Sec:ProjectedNeed).

## Relationship to existing programs

The proposed program is unique among the existing graduate programs at
the JSoE and other departments at UCSD. As explained earlier, the
program will leverage existing resources and course offerings from the
departments that host CRI faculty, mainly the Computer Science and
Engineering (CSE), Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), and
Mechanical and Aerospace (MAE) Engineering Departments.

## Interrelationship of the program with programs at other UC institutions

There are no Masters or Ph.D. programs in robotics currently offered
at other UC institutions. Comparable programs exising in another
institutions will be discussed in Appendix [Comparable degree
programs](#App:Comparable).

There are however, robotics courses offered as areas of concentration
or specialization in various programs in computer science and
engineering, including at UCSD. To name a couple of examples, the
*Robotics and Embedded Software* area of concentration as part of the
M.Eng. Program offered by the Electrical Engineering and in Computer
Science at UC Berkley, the *Dynamic Systems, Controls and Robotics*
area of concentration of the M.Eng. program offered by the Mechanical
Engineering Department at UC Santa Barbara, the ECE Department at UCSD
offers a specialization in \*Intelligent Systems, Robotics and
Control\*, and the MAE Department offers an especialization in
*Dynamics Systems & Controls*.

We believe that the time is ripe for a graduate degree in Robotics. By
taking advantage of the already existing synergy of teaching in
research taking place as part of the JSoE CRI we aim to establish a
world-class program that can meet the demand for knowledge and
experience in the field of robotics.

The proposed program will offer broader interdisciplinary
opportunities for learning and research in the area of tobotics. Since
the program is build upon existing classes, we believe that it will
not compete with the specializations currently offered at the ECE and
MAE departments, but rather strength those existing specialization by
bringing additional students and resources to the existing classes and
affiliated faculty.


## Department or group that will administer the program

The program will be administered by the JSoE Contextual Robotics
Institute (CRI), with day-to-day management support from the Computer
Science and Engineering (CSE) department.

CRI faculty is responsible for the academic direction of the program,
including the selection of existing and approval of new proposed
courses. Committees will be staffed and run by CRI faculty.

## Plan for evaluation of the program within offering departments, the Academic Senate and campuswide

This plan has been reviewed and approved by the CSE, ECE and MAE
Departments. We plan to submit it for appreciation by the Academic
Senate in the Spring of 2019 and expect to be reviewed campuswide in
Fall 2019.

## Course Requirements

There are foundation, breadth, depth, and research and capstone
requirements for the program, as articulated below. These course
requirements are intended to ensure that students are exposed to

1) fundamental concepts and tools (the foundation requirement), 
2) advanced, up-to-date views in topics outside their area (the breadth 
   requirement), and
3) a deep, current view of their research or
   specialization area (the depth requirements).
Furthermore, students are expected to fulfill a research and capstone
requirement as detailed below. The course requirements and how they
are to be articulated are illustrated in Figure \ref{figure}.
	
![Course requirements structurelabel{figure}][image-1]

### Foundation Requirement

The foundation requirement ensures that master’s students possess the
fundamental concepts and tools from mathematics and engineering
required to fulfill the breadth, depth and research
requirements. Students must complete three graduate courses (twelve
units) to satisfy this requirement. Courses must be taken for a letter
grade and completed with a grade of B- or higher. A list of courses
that can be used to satisfy the foundation requirement is listed below in
the section [Foundation Courses][1].

### Breadth Requirement

The breadth requirement ensures that master’s students share knowledge
across broad areas of robotics. Students must complete three graduate
courses (twelve units) in three of the five distinct specialization
areas of the program listed above to satisfy this requirement. Courses
must be taken for a letter grade and completed with a grade of B- or
higher. A list of courses that can be used to satisfy the breadth
requirement is listed below in the section [Specialization
Courses](#SpecializationCourses).

### Depth Requirement

The depth requirement ensures that master’s students acquire expertise
in a general research or specialization area. Students choose a depth
area from one of the five specialization areas of the program listed
above. Students must complete three graduate courses (eight units)
from this list. Courses must be taken for a letter grade. A list of
courses that can be used to satisfy the breadth requirement is listed
below in the section [Specialization
Courses](#SpecializationCourses).

Upon approval by the program director, elective courses taken for a
letter grade not listed in the section [Specialization
Courses](#SpecializationCourses) may count toward the depth
requirement.

Electives are chosen from graduate courses in CSE, ECE, MAE, or from
other departments as approved, such as Mathematics and Cognitive
Science. A maximum of one upper-division undergraduate course may
count as an elective, per the approved program list. Please refer to
the program's website for a list of approved electives.

### Research and Capstone Requirement

Students must complete the following research and capstone
requirements depending on the chosen plan as discussed below.

Research units are taken on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory
basis. Seminar and teaching units may not count toward the breadth,
depth, and research and capstone requirements, although both are
encouraged.

## Thesis or Comprehensive Exam

The M.Rob. degree can be pursued under either the **Thesis Plan I** or
the **Comprehensive Examination Plan II**. Both plans have the same foundation, breadth, and depth requirements as discussed above.

### Plan I: Thesis Option

Under this plan, students must complete at least four units of
research by enrolling in at least one of following courses:

* CSE 299. Research
* ECE 299. Research
* MAE 299. Graduate Research

A thesis based on the student’s research must be written and
subsequently reviewed by the master’s thesis committee. It is then
submitted as described in the general university requirements. The
master’s committee, appointed by the dean of the Graduate Division,
consists of three faculty members, with at least two members from
within the program from the CSE, ECE, or MAE departments.

### Plan II: Comprehensive Examination

Under this plan, students must execute a special project with an
adviser while enrolled in four units of:

* CSE 293. Special Project in Computer Science and Engineering (1–12)

ECE and MAE are in the process of approving a comparable class, which
will be in place by the time the program start.

The student must complete a practical comprehensive examination
designed to evaluate the student’s ability to integrate knowledge and
understanding as well as utilize associated skills. The exam will be
supervised by a faculty committee responsible for the content,
evaluation, and administration of the exam. Each question of the exam
requires the student to produce one or more artifacts representing a
solution. Artifacts may include, but are not limited to, source code,
design documentation, formal reasoning expressed via one or more
proofs or mathematical models, and/or expository prose. Due to the
nature of the exam, with each question taking the form of a project,
the exam will normally be completed over multiple quarters.

## Residency and Scholarship

For full-time students, all the requirements can be completed within
one to two years. Students must register for a minimum of three
academic quarters. Residency requirements are met by satisfactory
completion of at least four units per quarter. 

The 40 units of required course work must be taken for a letter grade
(A-F), except for Research (299 and 293 courses) for which only
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grades are allowed. Courses for
which a D or F is received may not be counted.

To maintain good academic standing, students must be making timely and
satisfactory progress toward completion of degree requirements and
must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 at UC San Diego.

## Faculty advisor

The program of work shall be under the supervision and subject to the
approval of a member of the faculty of the department.


# Projected Need {#Sec:ProjectedNeed}

Market demand for robotics technology has experienced robust growth in
the recent years and is forecast to accelerate even more rapidly as
technologies as diverse as driverless vehicles, artificial
intelligence, and cloud computing gain acceptance and become part of
everyday life. According to @murphy2017, the robotics marked in
various segments, such as industrial, commercial, military and
entertainment, is expected to grow at a rate of 18% in the next ten
years. The industrial robotics segment alone, according to @glaser2017,
is forecast to experience three fold growth.

The emergence of robotics as a key component of modern industry offers
enormous opportunity for the professional placement of graduates after
conclusion of the program. Opportunities abound locally, e.g. at
Qualcomm, General Atomics, Spawar, etc, as well as domestically and
internationally. Those opportunities are expected to be the main
driver of demand for the program, offering students from diverse
engineering backgrounds an opportunity to further their knowledge in
the field of robotics at one of the world premier robotics
research institutions.

The program is carefully designed to satisfy the needs of the growing
robotics marketplace while blending practice with theory around the
research interests of the participating faculty. The synergistic
combination of faculty from three departments allows the program to
offer broad coverage of robotics relevant disciplines as well as
opportunities for pursuing in-depth specialization in areas of
interest.

We forecast an initial annual cohort of 25 students that will
eventually grow to 75 by 2025. We anticipate that the students will be
30% international, 70% domestic within which 50% in-state.

# Faculty

The following current JSoE faculty is expected to participate in the
program:

1. Henrik I. Christensen, CSE, Professor, Ph.D.
2. Laurel Riek, CSE, Associate Professor, Ph.D.
3. Ryan Kastner, CSE, Professor, Ph.D.
4. Steven Swanson, CSE, Professor, Ph.D.

The above roster of leading scientists with a diverse set of
expertises in the field of robotics --- as supported by their detailed
CVs to be found on a separated document attached to this proposal,
provides an excellent starting point from which the proposed program
can mature and grow. We anticipate the hiring of additional faculty in
the near future by the JSoE that could be brought to contribute and
complement the above roster.

Please find in the appendix [Supporting
Letters](#App:SupportingLetters), letters from the chairs of the CSE,
ECE, and MAE departments supporting the engagement of the above listed
faculty on the proposed program.

# Courses

The program curriculum will draw exclusively from existing courses at
CSE, ECE and MAE departments and a few new proposed courses. No new
courses will be proposed nor required for the implementation of the
program.

The existing courses, of which a catalog description can be found in
the appendix [Courses][2], are listed below in the section
[Existing Courses][3]. All courses are four units
courses.

Because all of the courses are already being regularly offered by the
CSE, ECE, and MAE departments, there will be minimum impact on
staffing and faculty course load, which will continue to be arranged
by and in coordination with the corresponding department chairs. The
growth on enrollment due to the implementation of the proposed program
is expected to be managed with current levels of faculty resources and
additional teaching assistant support. 

Other impact on resources will be discussed later in the section
[Resources Requirements][4].

## Proposed Courses

There will be no new proposed courses.

# Resource Requirements {#Sec:ResourceRequirements}

We estimate the following resource needs for the first five years in
the categories listed below. Funding to cover these costs will come
primarily from tuition generated by the projected enrollment
discussed earlier in the section [Projected Need][5].

The proposed program is inline with the current growth plan by the UC
San Diego. 

By taking advantage of the existing alignment of the proposed program
with the participating faculty, there will be minimal reallocation
impact on the contributing M.S. and Ph.D. programs at CSE, ECE and
MAE. 

## FTE Faculty

As we take advantage of current faculty resources at CSE, ECE, and MAE
departments, there will be no need for additional FTE faculty beyond
the currently planned.

## Library Acquisitions

The current catalog of the UCSD Geisel Library already covers most of
the needs for the proposed program, with future acquisitions being
tuned to better fit the needs of the proposed courses and increased
enrollment.

## Computing Costs

We do not anticipate any additional computing costs or needs that are
beyond the available resources at the CSE, ECE, and MAE departments.

## Equipment

The program will use existing equipment on the CSE, ECE, and MAE departments.

## Space and Capital Facilities

There is a need for the Master program to have access to a joint space
for experiential and experimental laboratory based courses. The room
must be able to hold 25 students at a time and be able to accommodate
the projected  load of 75 students per cohort during the program.

## Other Operating Costs

Nothing at the moment.

# Graduate student support

Since the proposed program is at the Master's level, students
enrolling in the program are expected to cover the costs of tuition,
laboratories and enrollment fees. Such fees are expected to generate
enough revenue to provide adequate instructional support in the form
of teaching assistantships that will be fulfilled primarily by current
Ph.D. students from the CSE, ECE, and MAE departments engaged in
research in the area of robotics with the affiliated faculty.

# Governance

The program will be administered by the CRI, with day-to-day
management support from the CSE department. 

CRI faculty is responsible for the academic direction of the program,
including the selection of existing and approval of new proposed
courses. Committees will be staffed and run by CRI faculty.

A set of Bylaws directing the proposed program can be found in the
appendix [Bylaws][6].

# Changes in Senate Regulations

No changes in senate regulations are required.

dynamics, kinematics, mechatronics, control, locomotion, and
manipulation. ***Prerequisites:*** non-graduate students may enroll with
consent of instructor.

**MAE 207. Haptics Interfaces (4)** This course provides an
introduction to the design and control of haptic systems, which
provide touch feedback to human users interacting with virtual
environments and teleoperated robots. Topics include haptic-focused
mechatronic design, system modeling and analysis (kinematics and
dynamics), human-in-the-loop feedback control, and haptic feedback
evaluation. Coursework includes lab-based homework assignments and a
substantial, research-oriented project. This course is directed toward
graduate students and advanced undergraduates in engineering and
computer science. Recommended experience with: dynamic systems,
programming, feedback control design, mechatronics, and hardware
prototyping. ***Prerequisite:*** consent of instructor.

**MAE 207. Bioinspired mobile robotics (4)** Animals are capable of
wonderful feats of locomotion and many of the most cutting edge robots
seek to embody those capabilities. Roboticists have long looked to
nature for inspiration in robot design, actuation, and control. In
this class we will explore the world of bio-inspired mobile robotics
using lecture and project based work. The primary goal of the class is
to expose students to state-of-the-art bioinspired robot platforms,
robot technologies (actuators, sensors, controls), and robot design
principles. This will be motivated and contextualized throughout the
course by examples from biological locomotion.  This course focuses on
locomotion and so we will be keenly interested in mechanics, dynamics,
and control of movement. In this course we will cover varied types of
mobility in robotics and biology including legged locomotion
(running/climbing), flight (flapping wing, fixed wing), continuum
“snake-like” movement (serpentine, sidewinding, rectilinear waves),
and swimming. In order to develop technical skills in robot design
student groups will work on a hands-on research project to design and
test legged robot modules. By the end of this course students will
have gained hands-on experience with experimental robot hardware,
motivated by theory and experiments from
biomechanics. ***Prerequisite:*** consent of instructor.

**MAE 207. Topics in Engineering Science (4)** A course to be
given at the discretion of the faculty in which topics of current
interest in engineering will be presented. ***Prerequisite:*** consent of
instructor.
 
**MAE 242. Robot Motion Planning (4)** Modeling, solving, and analyzing
planning problems for single robots or agents. Configuration space for
motion planning, sampling-based motion planning, combinatorial motion
planning, feedback motion planning, differential models, and
nonholonomic constraints. Basic decision-theory and dynamic programming,
sensor and information spaces.

**MAE 247. Cooperative Control of Multi-agent Systems (4)** Tools for
the design of cooperative control strategies for multi-agent systems are
presented. Topics include continuous and discrete-time evolution models,
proximity graphs, performance measures, invariance principles, and
coordination algorithms for rendezvous, deployment, flocking, formation
of autonomous vehicles and consensus.
